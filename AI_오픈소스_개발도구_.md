Each ML/AI project stakeholder requires specialized tools that efficiently enable them to manage the various stages of an ML/AI project, from data preparation and model development to deployment and monitoring. They tend to use specialized open source tools because of their contribution as a significant catalyst to the advancement, development, and ease of AI projects. As a result, numerous open source AI tools have emerged over the years, making it challenging to pick from the available options.

This article highlights some factors to consider when picking open source tools and introduces you to 25 open-source options that you can use for your AI project.

Picking open source tools for AI project
The open source tooling model has allowed companies to develop diverse ML tools to help you handle particular problems in an AI project. The AI tooling landscape is already quite saturated with tools, and the abundance of options makes tool selection difficult. Some of these tools even provide similar solutions. You may be tempted to lean toward adopting tools just because of the enticing features they present. However, there are other crucial factors that you should consider before selecting a tool, which include:

Popularity
Impact
Innovation
Community engagement
Relevance to emerging AI trends.

A tool with a track record of addressing pain points, delivering measurable improvements, providing long-term project sustainability, and adapting to evolving needs of the problems of an AI project is a good measure of an impactful tool that stakeholders are interested in leveraging.

Innovation
Tools that embrace more modern technologies and offer unique features demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement and have the potential to drive advancements and unlock new possibilities.

Community engagement
Active community engagement fosters collaboration, provides support, and ensures a tool's continued relevance and improvement.

Relevance to emerging AI trends
Tools aligned with emerging trends like LLMs enable organizations to leverage the latest capabilities, ensuring their projects remain at the forefront of innovation.

25 open source tools for your AI project
Based on these factors, here are 25 tools that you and the different stakeholders on your team can use for various stages in your AI project.

1. KitOps
Multiple stakeholders are involved in the machine learning development lifecycle which requires different MLOps tools and environments at various stages of the AI project., which makes it hard to guarantee an organized, portable, transparent, and secure model development pipeline.

This introduces opportunities for model lineage breaks and accidental or malicious model tampering or modifications during model development. Since the contents of a model are a "black box”—without efficient storage and lineage—it is impossible to know if a model's or model artifact's content has been tampered with between model development, staging, deployment, and retirement pipelines.



KitOps provides AI project stakeholders with a secure package called ModelKit that they can use to share and manage models, code, metadata, and artifacts throughout the ML development lifecycle.

The ModelKit is an immutable OCI-standard artifact that leverages normal container-native technologies (similar to Docker and Kubernetes), making them seamlessly interoperable and portable across various stakeholders using common software tools and environments. As an immutable package, ModelKit is tamper-proof. This tamper-proof property provides stakeholders with a versioning system that tracks every single update to any of its content (i.e., models, code, metadata, and artifacts) throughout the ML development and deployment pipelines.

2. LangChain
LangChain is a machine learning framework that enables ML engineers and software developers to build end-to-end LLM applications quickly. Its modular architecture allows them to easily mix and match its extensive suite of components to create custom LLM applications.

These profiles track changes in datasets over time, helping detect data drift – a common cause of model performance degradation. It also provides tools for visualizing key summary statistics from dataset profiles, making it easy to understand data distributions and identify anomalies.



17. Feast
Defining, storing, and accessing features for model training and online inference in silos (i.e., from different locations) can lead to inconsistent feature definitions, data duplication, complex data access and retrieval, etc. Feast solves the challenge of stakeholders managing and serving machine learning (ML) features in development and production environments.

Its primary purpose is to streamline the execution of complex, multi-step workflows, making it particularly well-suited for machine learning (ML) and data processing tasks. It enables ML engineers to define each step of the ML workflow (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment) as individual containers, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure reproducibility.

Argo workflows are defined using DAGs, where each node represents a step in the workflow (typically a containerized task), and edges represent dependencies between steps. Workflows can be defined as a sequence of tasks (steps) or as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to capture dependencies between tasks.
